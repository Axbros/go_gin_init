## 🌍 Go_Gin_init

##### ⚡️ Lightweight, efficient, fast, out-of-the-box scaffolding for Goweb development based on Gin framework

- ⚙️ Configuration file management：The configuration file is read through the Viper open source library of Go language
- 🔐 Authority management：The JWT middleware is used to implement the restriction of user interface access rights
- 📒 Log management：Six log levels were encapsulated, the system operation was logged, and the log was standardized and written to a file
-  😄 Type management：Encapsulate type conversion to facilitate conversion between different types
-  🙅 Error code management：The error code is encapsulated uniformly, and the standard return of status code is realized
-  📁 Pagination management：Encapsulate paging parameters to achieve unified paging return of all interfaces
-  ☁️ File Upload management： The interface of file upload and file access was encapsulated, and the secure file upload (using MD5 algorithm to rename the file) and access were realized
