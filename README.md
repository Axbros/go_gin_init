## 🌍 Go_Gin_init

##### ⚡️ Lightweight, efficient, fast, out-of-the-box scaffolding for Goweb development based on Gin framework

##### Current Features

- ⚙️ Configuration file management：The configuration file is read through the Viper open source library of Go language
- 🔐 Authority management：The JWT middleware is used to implement the restriction of user interface access rights
- 📒 Log management：Six log levels were encapsulated, the system operation was logged, and the log was standardized and written to a file
<<<<<<< HEAD
-  😄 Type management：Encapsulate type conversion to facilitate conversion between different types
-  🙅 Error code management：The error code is encapsulated uniformly, and the standard return of status code is realized
-  📁 Pagination management：Encapsulate paging parameters to achieve unified paging return of all interfaces
-  ☁️ File Upload management： The interface of file upload and file access was encapsulated, and the secure file upload (using MD5 algorithm to rename the file) and access were realized

##### 🚗 Future Features

- 📧 Email alarm Handling：A simple E-mail alarm function needs to be implemented to ensure that after the Panic occurs, the corresponding person in charge can be notified by E-mail alarm in time after the arrest.
- ⏰ Interface current limiting control：As your application runs, new clients are coming in all the time, and sometimes there is a sudden spike in traffic (e.g., a marketing campaign).If you don't cull the peak in time and your resources aren't keeping up, it can lead to accidents
- 🐱 Unified timeout control：It prevents upstream and downstream applications from interfering with each other, leading to cascaded reactions that ultimately make the entire cluster application unavailable at a certain scale
- ⛓️ Link tracking：Distributed link tracing is used to solve part of the problem of observability
